 Let‚Äôs explore how to overload functions in the FreeBASIC programming language.

Function Overloading:
Function overloading allows you to define multiple functions with the same name, but different parameter lists or signatures.
The idea is to provide flexibility by allowing a single function name to handle various scenarios based on the input it receives.
When you call an overloaded function, the compiler determines which version of the function to execute based on the arguments you provide.
Syntax for Overloading Functions:
To overload a function in FreeBASIC, follow these steps:
Declare the function using the Overload keyword.
Specify the function name and its parameters.
Repeat this process for each variant of the function.
Example:
Declare Function CalculateArea(radius As Double) As Double Overload
Declare Function CalculateArea(length As Double, width As Double) As Double Overload

Function CalculateArea(radius As Double) As Double
    Return 3.14 * radius * radius
End Function

Function CalculateArea(length As Double, width As Double) As Double
    Return length * width
End Function

Usage:
Suppose you want to compute the area of a circle or a rectangle.
By overloading the CalculateArea function, you can handle both cases seamlessly.
When you call CalculateArea, the appropriate version of the function will be invoked based on the number and types of arguments you provide.
Benefits of Function Overloading:
Clarity: Overloaded functions make your code more readable by grouping related functionality under a single name.
Consistency: Users can use the same function name regardless of the shape (circle or rectangle) they are dealing with.
Flexibility: You can extend the function to handle additional shapes without changing its name.
In summary, function overloading in FreeBASIC empowers you to create versatile functions that adapt to different scenarios, making your code more expressive and maintainable! üöÄüë©‚Äçüíª
